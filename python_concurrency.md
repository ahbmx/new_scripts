Python's `concurrent.futures` module makes threading cleaner:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import requests
import paramiko

# Example SSH function
def ssh_command(host):
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    client.connect(host, username='user', password='pass')
    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('uptime')
    output = stdout.read().decode()
    client.close()
    return f"{host}: {output}"

# Example REST API function
def rest_call(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return f"{url}: {response.status_code}"

hosts = ['host1', 'host2', 'host3']
urls = ['http://api1.com', 'http://api2.com']

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    ssh_futures = [executor.submit(ssh_command, h) for h in hosts]
    api_futures = [executor.submit(rest_call, u) for u in urls]

    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(ssh_futures + api_futures):
        print(future.result())
```

### ðŸ”¹ Alternatives

* If you're using **async-capable libraries** (e.g., `aiohttp`, `asyncssh`), consider **`asyncio`** for even better efficiency with many connections.
* Only use `multiprocessing` if you're also doing **heavy processing** *after* the I/O (like parsing logs, compressing data, etc.).

Would you like help adapting this to your exact setup (e.g., number of hosts, specific SSH commands, auth method)?
