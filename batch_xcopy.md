Here's an **enhanced batch script** that checks for **network availability** before running the sync operation and is **optimized for Scheduled Task** use. It includes:

âœ… **Network connectivity check** (ping test)  
âœ… **Drive mapping verification** (with auto-reconnect if needed)  
âœ… **XCopy sync with exclusions** (only newer files)  
âœ… **Proper error logging** (for troubleshooting)  
âœ… **Exit codes** for Scheduled Task monitoring

### **Key Improvements for Scheduled Tasks**

1. **Network Connectivity Check**
   - Pings a reliable server (`8.8.8.8`) before proceeding
   - Fails fast with exit code `101` if no network

2. **Drive Mapping Resilience**
   - Auto-reconnects unmapped drives
   - Returns exit code `102` if drives can't be mapped

3. **Proper Exit Codes**
   - `0` = Success
   - `1` = XCopy warnings
   - `101` = Network unavailable
   - `102` = Drive mapping failed

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Date/time stamps all operations
   - Stores logs in dedicated folder (`C:\SyncLogs`)

5. **Scheduled Task Configuration**
   - Runs whether user is logged in or not
   - Configure to retry on failure

---

### **How to Set Up the Scheduled Task**

1. **Save the script** as `network_sync.cmd`
2. **Open Task Scheduler** and create a new task:
   - General Tab:
     - Name: `Network Folder Sync`
     - Run whether user is logged on or not
     - Run with highest privileges
   - Triggers Tab:
     - Set your schedule (e.g., daily at 2 AM)
   - Actions Tab:
     - Program: `cmd.exe`
     - Arguments: `/c "C:\path\to\network_sync.cmd"`
   - Conditions Tab:
     - Uncheck "Start only if on AC power" if needed
   - Settings Tab:
     - Allow task to run on demand
     - If task fails: restart every 1 hour (up to 3 times)

3. **Test the task** by running it manually and checking:
   - The log file (`C:\SyncLogs\Sync_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.log`)
   - Task Scheduler's Last Run Result

---

### **Why This Works Better for Scheduled Tasks**

- **Self-healing**: Attempts to reconnect drives automatically
- **Fail-fast**: Won't waste time if network is down
- **Auditability**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Reliability**: Proper exit codes let Task Scheduler handle retries
