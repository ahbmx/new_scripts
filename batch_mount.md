Here's a batch script that checks if a network location is mounted as a drive letter and then syncs files using robocopy to a specific folder:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal

:: Configuration
set "DRIVE_LETTER=Z:"
set "NETWORK_PATH=\\server\share"
set "TARGET_FOLDER=C:\Backup\NetworkShare"
set "ROBOCOPY_LOG=C:\Logs\robocopy.log"
set "MAX_RETRIES=3"
set "RETRY_DELAY=10"

:: Check if drive is mapped
echo Checking if %DRIVE_LETTER% is mapped to %NETWORK_PATH%...
net use %DRIVE_LETTER% >nul 2>&1

if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
    echo Drive %DRIVE_LETTER% is already mapped.
) else (
    echo Mapping %DRIVE_LETTER% to %NETWORK_PATH%...
    net use %DRIVE_LETTER% %NETWORK_PATH% /persistent:no >nul 2>&1
    if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
        echo Failed to map %DRIVE_LETTER% to %NETWORK_PATH%
        exit /b 1
    )
)

:: Verify the drive is accessible
echo Verifying drive access...
dir %DRIVE_LETTER% >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Cannot access %DRIVE_LETTER%
    exit /b 1
)

:: Create target folder if it doesn't exist
if not exist "%TARGET_FOLDER%" (
    echo Creating target folder %TARGET_FOLDER%...
    mkdir "%TARGET_FOLDER%"
)

:: Sync files with robocopy
echo Starting robocopy sync...
set "RETRY_COUNT=0"

:RoboCopyRetry
robocopy "%DRIVE_LETTER%" "%TARGET_FOLDER%" /MIR /ZB /R:1 /W:1 /NP /LOG+:"%ROBOCOPY_LOG%" /TEE

if %errorlevel% geq 8 (
    set /a "RETRY_COUNT+=1"
    if %RETRY_COUNT% leq %MAX_RETRIES% (
        echo Robocopy failed with error level %errorlevel%. Retrying in %RETRY_DELAY% seconds...
        timeout /t %RETRY_DELAY% >nul
        goto RoboCopyRetry
    ) else (
        echo Robocopy failed after %MAX_RETRIES% attempts.
        exit /b 1
    )
) else (
    echo Robocopy completed successfully with return code %errorlevel%
)

:: Clean up - uncomment if you want to disconnect the drive after copying
:: echo Disconnecting %DRIVE_LETTER%...
:: net use %DRIVE_LETTER% /delete >nul 2>&1

echo Synchronization complete.
endlocal
```

### How to Use This Script:
1. Modify the configuration section at the top:
   - `DRIVE_LETTER`: The drive letter you want to check/map
   - `NETWORK_PATH`: The UNC path to the network share
   - `TARGET_FOLDER`: Local folder where files should be synced
   - `ROBOCOPY_LOG`: Path to the log file
   - `MAX_RETRIES`: Number of retry attempts if robocopy fails
   - `RETRY_DELAY`: Delay between retries (in seconds)

2. Robocopy options used:
   - `/MIR`: Mirror source to destination (including deletions)
   - `/ZB`: Uses restartable mode, falls back to backup mode
   - `/R:1`: Retry once on failed copies
   - `/W:1`: Wait 1 second between retries
   - `/NP`: No progress display
   - `/LOG+`: Append to log file
   - `/TEE`: Output to console and log file

3. The script will:
   - Check if the drive is already mapped
   - Map it if necessary
   - Verify the drive is accessible
   - Create the target folder if needed
   - Run robocopy with retry logic
   - (Optionally) disconnect the drive when done

4. Save the script with a `.bat` extension and run it with appropriate permissions.

Note: Remove the `::` before the disconnect commands if you want the script to automatically disconnect the drive after copying.
