Here's a batch script that checks if three specified network locations are mounted as drive letters, then synchronizes a local folder to one of the network locations using robocopy:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

:: Configuration
set DRIVE1=X
set DRIVE2=Y
set DRIVE3=Z
set NETPATH1=\\server1\share1
set NETPATH2=\\server2\share2
set NETPATH3=\\server3\share3

set LOCAL_FOLDER=C:\Local\Folder
set DESTINATION_FOLDER=\\server1\share1\Destination  :: This will be synced to

:: Check if network locations are mounted
set ALL_MOUNTED=true

for %%D in (%DRIVE1%, %DRIVE2%, %DRIVE3%) do (
    net use %%D: 2>nul | find "%%D:" >nul
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Drive %%D: is not mapped
        set ALL_MOUNTED=false
    )
)

if "%ALL_MOUNTED%"=="false" (
    echo One or more required network drives are not mapped
    echo Attempting to map drives...

    :: Map drive %DRIVE1%
    net use %DRIVE1%: %NETPATH1% /persistent:no 2>nul
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Failed to map %DRIVE1%: to %NETPATH1%
        pause
        exit /b 1
    )

    :: Map drive %DRIVE2%
    net use %DRIVE2%: %NETPATH2% /persistent:no 2>nul
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Failed to map %DRIVE2%: to %NETPATH2%
        pause
        exit /b 1
    )

    :: Map drive %DRIVE3%
    net use %DRIVE3%: %NETPATH3% /persistent:no 2>nul
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Failed to map %DRIVE3%: to %NETPATH3%
        pause
        exit /b 1
    )
)

echo All required network drives are mapped

:: Synchronize local folder to destination
echo Starting synchronization from %LOCAL_FOLDER% to %DESTINATION_FOLDER%
robocopy "%LOCAL_FOLDER%" "%DESTINATION_FOLDER%" /MIR /ZB /R:5 /W:5 /V /NP /LOG:"%TEMP%\Sync_Log_%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~-7,2%.txt"

if errorlevel 8 (
    echo ERROR: Robocopy encountered serious errors during synchronization
    pause
    exit /b 1
) else if errorlevel 1 (
    echo WARNING: Robocopy copied some files with some issues
) else (
    echo Synchronization completed successfully
)

endlocal
```

### How to Customize This Script:

1. **Drive Letters**: Change `DRIVE1`, `DRIVE2`, `DRIVE3` to the drive letters you want to check.
2. **Network Paths**: Update `NETPATH1`, `NETPATH2`, `NETPATH3` with your actual network share paths.
3. **Local Folder**: Set `LOCAL_FOLDER` to the path of the folder you want to sync.
4. **Destination Folder**: Set `DESTINATION_FOLDER` to the network path where you want to sync your local folder.

### Robocopy Options Explained:
- `/MIR`: Mirror source to destination (including purging deleted files)
- `/ZB`: Uses restartable mode; if access denied, switches to backup mode
- `/R:5`: Retries 5 times (default is 1 million)
- `/W:5`: Waits 5 seconds between retries (default is 30 seconds)
- `/V`: Verbose output
- `/NP`: No progress (don't display percentage copied)
- `/LOG`: Creates a log file in the specified location

### Error Handling:
- The script checks if all required drives are mapped, and if not, attempts to map them.
- If mapping fails, the script exits with an error.
- After synchronization, it checks robocopy's exit code to determine success/failure.

You can run this script manually or set it up as a scheduled task for regular synchronization.
